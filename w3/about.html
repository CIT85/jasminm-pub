            <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>I'm taking this course because I want to learn more about HTML and creating website. I love designing things so being able to design my own website for my business would be a game changer and a dream for me. Also, I've never really learned how to code so this would be a first for me as well.</p>

            <h2>Using ChatGPT for Research</h2>
            <p>I think ChatGPT is a game-changer for anyone who doesn't know how to code or create a website. It allows for someone like me who has limited knowledge on how to code, to be able to build an entire website. I think it's great at giving directions on how to correct coding errors as well.</p>
